        <h1 id="sticky">The Game of Chess</h1>
        <br><p>Chess is a strategic board game played between two players. It is one of the most popular and oldest games in the world, with a history of over a thousand years.</p>
    
        <h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
        <p>The main goal in chess is to checkmate your opponent's king. This means putting the king in a position where it is under threat of capture and cannot escape.</p><br>
    
        <h2>Chess Pieces</h2>
        <p>Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>King:</strong> The most important piece. The game is lost if the king is checkmated.</li>
            <li><strong>Queen:</strong> The most powerful piece, able to move in any direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Rook:</strong> Moves in straight lines horizontally or vertically.</li>
            <li><strong>Bishop:</strong> Moves diagonally across the board.</li>
            <li><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves in an ‚ÄòL‚Äô shape and can jump over pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Pawn:</strong> Moves forward but captures diagonally. Can be promoted to any piece upon reaching the opponent's end of the board.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="absolute">
            üëë The King must be protected at all costs!
        </div>
        
    
        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <p>Players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn. A piece may not move to a square occupied by another piece of the same color. Capturing removes the opponent's piece from the board.</p>>
    
        <h2>Why Chess is Important</h2>
        <p>Chess improves critical thinking, concentration, and problem-solving skills. It is widely used in schools to help students enhance their mental abilities.</p>
