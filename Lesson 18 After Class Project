                <h1>Sherlock Holmes</h1>
                <p>Sherlock Holmes is a legendary fictional detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 19th century. Famous for his extraordinary powers of observation and deduction, Holmes solves complex cases that often leave the police baffled. He resides at 221B Baker Street, London, where he works alongside his loyal friend and assistant, Dr. John Watson. Holmes is known for his use of forensic science, logical reasoning, and disguise techniques long before these became common in criminal investigations. Some of his most famous cases include The Hound of the Baskervilles, A Study in Scarlet, and The Adventure of the Speckled Band. Although brilliant, Holmes is also eccentric and socially detached, often immersed in violin playing or scientific experiments. Watson, a former army doctor, narrates most of the stories and brings warmth and relatability to Holmes’s brilliance. Sherlock Holmes has become an icon in detective fiction and is considered the greatest detective in literature. His adventures have inspired countless adaptations in movies, TV shows, and modern literature.</p>
